## Hey
This doc is to let you know how I work and what you can expect from me. 

## My Role
I am a Technical Lead and am here to make sure you are happy, productive, grow, and watch Pacific Rim at least once a year. I will make sure whatever you work on aligns with our team’s mission.

## What do I value most
I value getting shit done. I like when you see a problem and immediately try to fix it.

## 1:1s
We will have a scheduled 1:1 for 30 minutes once a week. If you have something you want to talk about before our 1:1, talk to me in person, slack, or put something on my calendar. I am flexible with my schedule.

I owe you regular feedback of how I think you are doing. 

This is your time to talk about whatever you want. 

I prefer to do 1:1s in person but we can do a call/zoom/whatever if necessary.

## Feedback
GiveMe feedback at any time over slack or in person. Constructive feedback is the main way you can help me identify when I need to improve on something or continue doing something. This can look like “Hey, I noticed this thing you did the other day, I think it was cool/not cool and you should continue/not continue to do this anymore.”

## Schedule
I do not have a standard schedule. I will usually WFH in the morning and come into the office around lunch. I will randomly WFH all day at least once a week.

I may not be on Slack in the morning but reach out to me anytime after 10am.

## Work Life Balance
You may see me on Slack deep into the night. If I am online, feel free to reach out if you have a question. This does not mean I expect you to be available at night (unless you are on-call of course). We have flexible hours and I take advantage of that all the time so I expect you to too. If you want to do a 10-6, or 11-7, or WFH for part of the day, that works for me. I mainly care about productivity.

## If you need something
Talk to me in person, slack me, or page me. I am here to help you. If it is off-hours, slack me and I will get back to you when I can. If it is urgent, page me. Urgent can be defined as “a large number of engineers are unable to do their jobs because one of our apps is broken” or we are having a negative customer impact.
